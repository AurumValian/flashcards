# FlashCards

[Ben McClung](https://github.com/AurumValian)

## Abstract

FlashCards is a game played in Node. The game reveals a question and the possible answers. The user types the answer into the command line, and the game will say whether the answer is correct or incorrect. It then reveals a new card until the deck is out of cards.

## Setup

FlashCards is not currently functional; however, to see the current code base, fork the repository on GitHub and clone it to your local device. If it were functional, using the command `node index.js` would run the server to play the game.



## Future Development

Future iterations of FlashCards will have the game playable. Past playability, the user should have multiple decks to choose and play through.
